# Windows Installation Guide for FowCrawler

## üöÄ Installation

### Method 1: Installer (Recommended)

1. **Download** `FowCrawler-Setup.exe` from the release
2. **Run the installer** (you may see Windows Defender warnings)
3. **Click "More info"** ‚Üí **"Run anyway"** if Windows Defender blocks it
4. **Follow the installation wizard**
5. **Launch from Start Menu** or Desktop shortcut

### Method 2: Portable Version

1. **Download** `FowCrawler-Windows.zip`
2. **Extract** to a folder (e.g., `C:\FowCrawler\`)
3. **Run** `FowCrawler.exe` from the extracted folder

## üêç Python Requirements

FowCrawler now includes all Python dependencies automatically! You only need Python itself installed:

### Install Python (Required)

1. **Download Python 3.8+** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
2. **Check "Add Python to PATH"** during installation
3. **Verify installation** by opening Command Prompt and running:
   ```cmd
   python --version
   ```

**Note**: You no longer need to manually install packages like Flask, Selenium, etc. - they're included with the app!

## üîß Troubleshooting

### ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED Error

If you see `GET http://localhost:5002/api/health/ net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`, this means the Python API server isn't starting properly.

#### Step 1: Check Python Installation

1. **Open Command Prompt** (Run as Administrator)
2. **Test Python**:
   ```cmd
   python --version
   ```
   If this fails, try:
   ```cmd
   python3 --version
   py --version
   ```

3. **If Python is not found**:
   - Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
   - Restart your computer after installation

#### Step 2: Check App Console Logs

1. **Run FowCrawler from Command Prompt** to see debug output:
   ```cmd
   cd "C:\Program Files\FowCrawler"  # or wherever installed
   FowCrawler.exe
   ```

2. **Look for these messages**:
   - `‚úÖ Python API server started successfully on port 5002!` = Working
   - `‚ùå All Python executables failed` = Python not found/working
   - `üêç Python check results:` = Shows what was tried

#### Step 3: Manual Python Test

Test if Python can run the API manually:

1. **Navigate to app directory**:
   ```cmd
   cd "C:\Program Files\FowCrawler\resources\python_api"
   ```

2. **Try running the API**:
   ```cmd
   python run.py
   ```

3. **If it works**, you should see:
   ```
   üöÄ Starting FOW Crawler API with WebSocket support...
   üì° API will be available at: http://localhost:5002
   ```

#### Step 4: Windows Defender Issues

Windows Defender may block the Python process:

1. **Open Windows Security**
2. **Go to Virus & threat protection**
3. **Add exclusion** for FowCrawler installation folder
4. **Temporarily disable real-time protection** to test

### App Opens But Shows Nothing/Blank Screen

This usually means the Python API backend isn't starting properly.

#### Solution 1: Check Python Installation

1. **Open Command Prompt**
2. **Run**: `python --version` or `python3 --version`
3. **If not found**: Install Python from python.org
4. **Restart the app** after installing Python

#### Solution 2: Install Dependencies Manually

Python dependencies are now included with the app. If you're still having issues:

```cmd
# Only install Python itself - dependencies are bundled
# Check if Python is properly installed
python --version
```

#### Solution 3: Check Windows Defender/Antivirus

1. **Windows Defender** might be blocking the Python process
2. **Add exception** for the FowCrawler installation folder
3. **Temporarily disable** real-time protection to test

### Windows Defender SmartScreen Warning

If you see "Windows protected your PC":

1. **Click "More info"**
2. **Click "Run anyway"**
3. This is normal for unsigned applications

### App Won't Start at All

#### Check for Missing Dependencies

1. **Install Visual C++ Redistributable**:
   - Download from Microsoft's website
   - Install both x64 and x86 versions

2. **Install .NET Framework** (if needed):
   - Usually pre-installed on Windows 10/11
   - Download from Microsoft if missing

#### Run as Administrator

1. **Right-click** on FowCrawler.exe
2. **Select "Run as administrator"**
3. This can help with permission issues

### Python API Won't Start

If the app opens but the backend doesn't work:

#### Check Python PATH

1. **Open Command Prompt**
2. **Run**: `where python` or `where python3`
3. **If not found**: Reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked

#### Manual Dependency Installation

```cmd
# Navigate to the app directory
cd "C:\Program Files\FowCrawler" # or wherever installed

# Dependencies are now bundled with the app!
# You only need Python itself installed
python --version
```

#### Check for Port Conflicts

The app uses port 5002 by default. If another app is using it:

1. **Close other applications** that might use port 5002
2. **Restart FowCrawler**

**Note**: We use port 5002 instead of 5000 because port 5000 is commonly used by macOS Control Center (AirPlay Receiver) and can cause conflicts.

### Performance Issues

#### Chrome/Selenium Issues

1. **Update Chrome** to the latest version
2. **Clear Chrome cache** and restart
3. **Close other Chrome instances** before using the app

#### Memory Issues

1. **Close unnecessary programs**
2. **Ensure 4GB+ RAM available**
3. **Check Task Manager** for high memory usage

## üîç Getting Debug Information

### Method 1: Run from Command Prompt

1. **Open Command Prompt**
2. **Navigate to app directory**:
   ```cmd
   cd "C:\Program Files\FowCrawler"
   ```
3. **Run the app**:
   ```cmd
   FowCrawler.exe
   ```
4. **Check console output** for error messages

### Method 2: Check Event Viewer

1. **Open Event Viewer** (Windows + R, type `eventvwr`)
2. **Navigate to**: Windows Logs ‚Üí Application
3. **Look for FowCrawler entries** with errors

## üìã System Requirements

- **Windows**: 10 or later (64-bit recommended)
- **Python**: 3.8 or later
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM minimum
- **Storage**: 1GB free space
- **Internet**: Required for League of Legends data fetching

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

### Windows Defender Warnings

The app may trigger Windows Defender because:
- It's not code-signed (requires expensive certificate)
- It uses web scraping (Selenium/ChromeDriver)
- It makes network requests

**The app is safe** - you can review the source code at: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/R-thinking/FowPlayerSearch)

### Firewall Settings

If the app can't connect to League of Legends APIs:
1. **Allow FowCrawler** through Windows Firewall
2. **Check corporate/antivirus firewalls**

## üÜò Still Need Help?

1. **Check the GitHub Issues**: [Issues Page](https://github.com/R-thinking/FowPlayerSearch/issues)
2. **Run with debug output** using Command Prompt method above
3. **Include error messages** when reporting issues
